## Notice:
During the development process, I faced a challenge in designing the database structure to represent invoices containing multiple items. Here’s a summary of the issue and its resolution:

> **Challenge:**  
> Initially, I created a separate table for individual invoices and used a foreign key in this table to reference the multi-invoice ID. However, this approach was incorrect.  
>   
> **Solution:**  
> The correct design was to have a single table with two foreign keys:  
> - One referencing the invoice.  
> - One referencing the product.  

> Additionally, I needed a table for invoices with multiple items (composite invoices) and a separate table for single-item invoices.

I regret the mistakes I made during this process, but as a junior developer, I view these challenges as opportunities to learn and grow.
